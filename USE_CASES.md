## Implementation Priority

1. Start with movements[] and equipment[] - these unlock the most use cases
2. Add workout_type and time_domain for basic categorization  
3. Extract workout_name for benchmark searches
4. Build more sophisticated fields based on user feedback

The beauty of the current semantic search is that it already handles many of these queries reasonably well through natural language understanding, but structured metadata would make the results more precise and enable faceted search interfaces.
