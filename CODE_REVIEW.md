# Code Review Checklist - wodrag Project

## üö® Critical Issues (Fix Immediately)

- [ ] **Database Connection Leaks** (`wodrag/database/workout_repository.py:39`)
  - PostgreSQL connections created but never properly closed
  - Risk: Connection pool exhaustion in production
  - Fix: Use context managers or connection pooling

- [ ] **API Key Security Pattern** (`wodrag/services/embedding_service.py:20`)
  - Using deprecated `openai.api_key` assignment
  - Risk: Potential key exposure and incompatibility
  - Fix: Use modern OpenAI client initialization

- [ ] **Missing Method Implementation** (`wodrag/services/workout_service.py:139`)
  - Calls `hybrid_search()` method that doesn't exist
  - Risk: Runtime failures
  - Fix: Implement method or use existing `search_summaries()`

## üî• High Priority Issues

- [ ] **Type Safety Violations**
  - Missing return type on `_get_pg_connection()` method
  - Inconsistent typing patterns across the codebase
  - Current: ~70% type coverage (Target: >95%)

- [ ] **Poor Error Handling** (`wodrag/database/workout_repository.py:175`)
  - Generic `except Exception` masks specific database errors
  - Impact: Difficult debugging and poor user experience
  - Fix: Catch specific exception types

- [ ] **Code Duplication**
  - Supabase client initialization duplicated across scripts
  - Similar error handling patterns repeated
  - Impact: Maintenance burden and inconsistency
  - Fix: Extract to shared utility module

- [ ] **Add Integration Tests**
  - No integration tests for database operations
  - Missing tests for data processing pipeline
  - Current: ~60% test coverage (Target: >80%)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium Priority Issues

- [ ] **Architectural Inconsistencies**
  - Mixing Supabase REST API and direct PostgreSQL in same repository
  - Impact: Confusing abstraction layers, hard to reason about
  - Fix: Separate into distinct repository implementations

- [ ] **Performance Problems** (`wodrag/database/workout_repository.py:360-377`)
  - Analytics fetch all data client-side instead of using SQL aggregation
  - Impact: Poor performance as data grows
  - Fix: Use database aggregation functions

- [ ] **Inefficient Batch Operations** (`scripts/generate_openai_embeddings.py:78-88`)
  - Updates database one record at a time instead of batch updates
  - Fix: Use batch update operations

- [ ] **Resource Management**
  - No connection pooling
  - No caching of embeddings
  - No rate limiting for external APIs

- [ ] **Configuration Management**
  - Hardcoded vector dimensions (1536)
  - Complex environment variable handling
  - No centralized config system
  - Fix: Implement centralized configuration management

## üìã Low Priority Issues

- [ ] **Code Style Issues** (29 linting issues total)
  - Trailing whitespace in multiple files
  - Long lines exceeding 88 characters
  - Unused imports
  - Fix: Run `uv run ruff format --fix` and address remaining issues

- [ ] **Documentation Gaps**
  - Missing docstrings for many methods
  - No architecture documentation
  - README doesn't explain the system design
  - Fix: Add comprehensive docstrings and architecture docs

- [ ] **Dependency Management**
  - Review and optimize dependency versions
  - Consider dev dependency organization

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Improvements

- [ ] **Implement Dependency Injection**
  - Services directly instantiate dependencies
  - Impact: Poor testability and tight coupling
  - Fix: Use dependency injection pattern

- [ ] **Separate Database Access Patterns**
  - Choose either Supabase REST API OR direct PostgreSQL
  - Current mixed approach is confusing
  - Fix: Implement clear separation of concerns

- [ ] **Add Configuration Layer**
  - Centralize all configuration management
  - Environment-specific settings
  - Validation of required configuration

## üîí Security Improvements

- [ ] **Input Validation**
  - No data validation or sanitization for user inputs
  - Potential for embedding injection attacks
  - Fix: Add input validation and sanitization

- [ ] **Database Connection Security**
  - Complex password construction logic
  - Error-prone environment variable handling
  - Fix: Simplify and validate connection parameters

- [ ] **API Rate Limiting**
  - No rate limiting for OpenAI API calls
  - Risk: Quota exhaustion and service disruption
  - Fix: Implement rate limiting and retry logic

## üìä Quality Metrics Targets

- **Type Coverage**: 70% ‚Üí 95%
- **Test Coverage**: 60% ‚Üí 80%
- **Linting Issues**: 29 ‚Üí 0
- **Security Score**: 7/10 ‚Üí 9/10
- **Maintainability**: 6/10 ‚Üí 8/10

## üéØ Implementation Priority Order

1. **Week 1**: Critical issues (database connections, missing methods, API security)
2. **Week 2**: Type safety and error handling
3. **Week 3**: Code duplication and integration tests
4. **Week 4**: Architecture refactoring and performance optimization
5. **Month 2**: Configuration management and documentation
6. **Ongoing**: Code style and maintenance

## Overall Assessment: B-

Good foundational architecture with solid understanding of modern Python practices, but critical stability and security issues prevent production readiness. Focus on critical fixes first to establish a stable foundation.
