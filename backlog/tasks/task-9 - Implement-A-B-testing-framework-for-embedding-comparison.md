## Description

Create a testing framework to systematically compare search quality between full-text embeddings and summary embeddings. This will provide quantitative data to validate that summary embeddings maintain or improve search relevance while reducing computational costs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A/B testing script can run the same queries against both embedding types
- [ ] Search results are compared using relevance metrics and user-defined test queries
- [ ] Framework measures search latency and embedding storage requirements
- [ ] Test results are logged in a comparable format for analysis
- [ ] Framework supports batch testing of multiple query types
