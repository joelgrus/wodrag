## Description

Create an abstract base class for the embedding service and move OpenAI-specific implementation to a dedicated subclass. This refactoring will improve code organization, enable future support for multiple embedding providers, and follow the dependency inversion principle.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Abstract EmbeddingService base class is created with common interface methods
- [ ] OpenAIEmbeddingService subclass implements OpenAI-specific logic
- [ ] All existing functionality continues to work without breaking changes
- [ ] Type annotations are preserved and enhanced where needed
- [ ] All tests pass with updated implementation
